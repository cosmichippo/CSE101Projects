USAGE:

executable wordrange requires two textfile arguments : <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
INPUT should have one of each commands per line: 
  i STRING 
  r STRING1 STRING2
i inserts string STRING into an AVL tree, 
r provides the range between two strings STRING1 STRING2

PURPOSE:
Takes input of words from file, sorts words into AVL tree, provides range between two given words. words are ranked by alphabetical ordering.


Description of files:

BinarySearchTree.h - header file for binary search tree
BinarySearchTree.cpp - file containing implementation of header
main.cpp - file containing the IO interpretation that feeds input from INPUT into an AVL tree

Dependancies:
used BinarySearchTree.cpp and BinarySearchTree.h files from the CSE13 class i took in freshman year, 
This was just a standard BST, which i developed on to make it a functioning AVL tree. updated functions:
range
range_only_high
range_only_low
calculate_height
calculate_height_recursive
calculate_subtree
rotate_right
rotate_left
recursive_update
propagate
check_heights

additionally, added attributes height and subtree_size to TreeNode struct.
